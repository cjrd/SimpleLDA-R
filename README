This code provides a simple and straightforward (and slow!) implementation of variational expectation maximization inference for latent Dirchlet allocation. Check https://github.com/cjrd/SimpleLDA-R to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of this code and the accompanying tutorial.

lda-tutorial-reed.pdf: contains a conversational tutorial on latent Dirchlet allocation, along with a full pseudocode implementation. The R code in this file directly draws from this pseudocode.

cololda.R The implementation of the LDA inference method discussed above. The document is commented to aid readability and encourage the interested reader to work through the actual LDA implementation---convince yourself that LDA isn't magic!

auxfunctions.R Auxiliary functions that have been removed from the main script (cololda.R) to improve readability. Source these functions before sourcing cololda.R
